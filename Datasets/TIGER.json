This is because the global ecosystem in 2030 might still be in a transient, headed for much more significant effects after time lags perhaps of the order of decades.

The most important emission is carbon dioxide, the atmospheric content of which has varied between 0.15 and 0.3 per cent over the past half million years. It is only harmful to humans or other animals at concentrations of over 10 per cent and life actually evolved when the atmospheric content was about 7 per cent A doubling of carbon dioxide content to about 0.6 per cent is likely over the coming century. Almost all scientists agree that the main direct effect of this is to increase average global temperatures by slightly over 1°C (beyond a doubling of its share, further carbon dioxide increases have a negligible climate effect) Most models estimate that this is compounded by feedbacks bringing 2-4°C temperature increases. But those feedback effects are unproven and their impact may even be negative. This is at the heart of the differences between ‘warmists’ and ‘deniers’ Higher temperatures stemming from carbon dioxide emissions are likely to compound what most scientists speculate is a trend recovery from the cooler climate experienced during the ‘Little Ice Age’ (which ended a century and a half ago) Each summer brings ‘the hottest day ever’ claims for some area. Sometimes we hear ‘the coldest day ever’ claims. And many cite these occurrences and well publicised storms as proof that ‘climate change’ (the new euphemism for ‘global warming’) is taking place.

Is vaccination more or less effective than pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis (PreP or PEP), modeled on protocols for HIV/AIDS? A trial with a head-to head comparison would be needed. How safe are the vaccines? It is of course impossible to rule out long-term complications when testing has lasted only a few months. The most important is the effect on fertility, which would require years to manifest. The published protocols do not mention how this will be monitored.

Mr. Marshall’s company, Go Newclear Productions, both created and hosted websites for both Ethical Oil and Conservative cabinet ministers Joe Oliver, Pierre Poilievre and Jason Kenney.

The simple fact is that, since the beginning of this century, the average global temperature has flatlined; indeed, over the past 18 months it has fallen back, and according to the satellite measurements of temperature, it is now basically back at the level it was in 1979, when such measurements started to be taken.",

We Look forward to having you join us In Palm Springs, you’ll have the opportunity to join the most strategic market-oriented minds in the business world to advance a plan to defend our free-enterprise system Together, we’ll discuss how to effectively address short-term policy threats in 2013 while building toward free-market gains in 2014 and beyond. As a new participant, you will offer a valuable perspective on this group’s rigorous post-election assessment as well as the strategies presented at the meeting We have developed a program that we believe will not only maximize the value of your two days with us, but also your ability to effectively achieve what we believe to be your policy, political and philanthropic goals. Among other topics, in April, we’ll discuss how to more effectively engage growing demographic groups, such as Hispanic and Latino voters, and how to encourage principled and effective advocates of free enterprise to run for office You’ve likely heard many different takes on the 2012 election. And, as you may know from your experience, this type of analysis is not an end in and of itself. As we would within Koch companies, the post-election analysis must be geared toward productive next seps, particularly focusing on where and how we must innovate to achieve our challenging objectives We’ll be joined by a strong line-up of speakers, including several U.S. governors, senators, members of the U.S. House leadership and top political analysts and commentators. We all look forward d to hearing these leaders’ thoughts on the important issues facing our country, and invite your participation through question and answer sessions You’ll also hear strategies that will be central to these efforts going forward scuh as  – Reaching the right people with the right message. Understanding key customer segments – and more importantly the issues that matter to them – will be crucial to educating and mobilization key constituencies in future educational and political battles  – Hispanic, women and youth engagement. Allies will present an approach to more effectively communicate to these growing demographics, all of which will play a critical role in advancing free enterprise  – Candidate recruitment and training. A plan will be shared to help recruit more principled and effective advocates of free-enterprise ot run for office Of course, these only cover a few of the many topics we’ll discuss in April Your efforts will not only effect positive change today, but for years and decades to come. After all, as you’ll see in April, it’s this group’s long-term focus that keeps us fighting for freedom, prosperity and opportunity – even when times are tough.  look forward to seeing you at April’s meeting.

Ms. Mercer’s family foundation also supports politicians the agitators despise, and organizations or scientists with views contrary to their belief in human-caused, catastrophic global warming The signers of this letter include many scientists, with a deep understanding of climate. The case for harm from catastrophic global warming is growing weaker as more is learned about the Earth’s climate system, and about the poor predictive power of computer climate models. The Earth has supported abundant life many times in the geological past when there were much higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is quite likely that future generations will benefit from the enrichment of Earth’s atmosphere with more carbon dioxide. And there is no doubt that policies advocated by many of the protestors will cause economic harm across the world, especially to those hoping to climb out of poverty It is unlikely that Ms. Mercer and all of the signers would vote for the same political candidates.

Human influences on the climate (largely the accumulation of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion) are a physically small (1%) effect on a complex, chaotic, multicomponent and multiscale system. Unfortunately, the data and our understanding are insufficient to usefully quantify the climate’s response to human influences. However, even as human influences have quadrupled since 1950, severe weather phenomena and sea level rise show no significant trends attributable to them. Projections of future climate and weather events rely on models demonstrably unfit for the purpose. As a result, rising levels of CO2 do not obviously pose an immediate, let alone imminent, threat to the earth’s climate.",

    "claim": "There is no climate emergencyA global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message. Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warmingThe geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, withnatural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is nosurprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming Warming is far slower than predictedThe world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance. It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change Climate policy relies on inadequate modelsClimate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools. Moreover, they most likely exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on EarthCO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide Global warming has not increased natural disastersThere is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realitiesThere is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world.",

[… hy are they forcing out Cato board members, all strong, principled libertarians who have been heavily involved with Cato — financially and organizationally — for years?

They told Bob that they intended to use their board majority to remove Ed Crane from Cato and transform our Institute into an intellectual ammo-shop for Americans for Prosperity and other allied (presumably, Koch-controlled) organizations. That statement of intent is certainly consistent with what we’ve been hearing from both Kevin Gentry and Nancy Pfotenhauer.

    "claim": "The climate emergency is not an emergency at all. Why? Because the problem is easy to solve. There are two simple solutions if we are only willing to consider them rationally. First, engineers have shown that it is possible to remove CO2 from the atmosphere by direct air capture, and then store it. Initially, the cost will be expensive, but nothing even close to what the coronavirus will cost. Further, while the technology develops, we can wait to see how fast temperatures are rising, and what sorts of damages we might expect Second is an option that would need to be implemented sooner, but would benefit society nonetheless. Working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a group of nuclear engineers at TerraPower has developed a Traveling Wave nuclear Reactor (TWR) that is absolutely safe to use. If significant numbers of TWRs could be built, costs would be competitive with other sources of power generation. Indeed, as my own research (and that of others) has shown, any serious effort to reduce CO2 emissions from the generation of electricity will require a shift toward nuclear energy. If environmentalists oppose nuclear energy, they will have no other way to retain an economic standard of living that is even close to what we enjoy now and, at the same time, reduce CO2 emissions by even half nfortunately, the main obstacle to the avoidance of catastrophes, such as COVID-19, occurs when (1) our focus shifts from immediate, real threats to future questionable ones; and, (2) all current problems are blamed on the questionable future threat. By putting all of our preparedness eggs in the climate-change basket, we are left not only to weather the storms associated with those threats for which we are unprepared. By attributing all our problems to climate change, we also assume there is one single solution to all our problems and that is to stop burning fossil fuels. How naïve have we become?",

Unfortunately, the decibels of the discourse on this subject have risen to such levels that there are very few left to quietly and civilly discuss climate change and to debate what actions man should take to limit emissions, but also to prepare for a changing future. In his 2007 classic, Cool It, Bjorn Lomborg made the same point: He asked: ‘Why [has] the debate over climate change stifled rational dialogue and killed meaningful dissent? As societies become wealthier, things inevitably happen regarding the environment: Emissions become reduced; rivers, oceans and streams become cleaner, and better land management allows for re-forestation.

    "claim": "That brings me to the subject of climate change, popularly known as “global warming.” Global warming is a real thing. It is caused by the accretion of chemicals in the atmosphere that trap solar energy, increasing surface temperatures. This process has been ebbing and flowing for hundreds of millions of years in a phenomenon scientists call the “carbon cycle.” Today the Earth is gradually warming, and if that trend were to continue indefinitely it could eventually become uninhabitable (as it was for much of its geological history) But despite the fact climate change is real, the response of the political system to its discovery has all the earmarks of a mania. The overheated rhetoric (no pun intended) surrounding its public discussion is not sustainable, and the draconian plans advanced to correct it are sure to have destructive consequences for the existing political and economic order Because the carbon cycle unfolds much more slowly than political cycles, the changes proposed to deal with global warming will inevitably produce a political backlash. The backlash will erode the popular support for those who have advanced a global warming agenda, and discredit other ideas they espouse that are unrelated to climate change his problem can be mitigated by stressing positive solutions to global warming such as development of new technology. Unfortunately, more regulation seems to be the default setting of the modern Democratic Party, and it therefore will absorb the full burden of the popular backlash when voters realize what initiatives like “cap-and-trade” mean for their everyday lives.",

So-called ‘hottest year’ claims are just a fancy way of saying that the ‘global warming pause’ has essentially continued. Arctic ice changes are not ‘proof’ of manmade global warming, nor are they unprecedented, unusual, or cause for alarm, according to experts and multiple peer-reviewed studies. Sea levels have been rising since the last ice age ended more than 10,000 years ago. There is currently no acceleration in sea level rise.   Dr. Mann was at the center of the Climategate scandal. His graph and the data and methodology behind it have been scrutinized and debunked in peer-reviewed studies by numerous climate scientists, statisticians, and other experts. Many in the media repeatedly cite the various Climategate investigations as an ‘exoneration’ of the  global warming scientists. But a closer look reveals that the investigations were nothing more than the global warming industry pretending to investigate itself, and of course finding no wrongdoing.

There have not been eruptions of that magnitude since, such that the absence of such major eruptions might permit greater absorbed solar radiation in the climate system than otherwise would occur.

A man may desire sex, or more usually simulated sex, with himself, with another man, with a child, with a couch on the side of a road (a real case), with a goat, with another man’s wife, with a dead body, with those missing limbs because they are missing limbs, with only females of certain races, with men who pretend to be women, and on and on and on He may desire sex (or simulated sex) in one way today and another tomorrow. Desire can be fluid. For instance, many men do not realize that they desire simulated sex with other men until they are introduced to the concept from older men. And we recall that some men who were called ‘gay’ have fathered children. The number of possible propensities, or ‘orientations,’ is practically infinite … It is thus no surprise that the man who defines himself by his temptations is the man more likely to slip. Since desire is fluid and temptations are as many, as orientation ideologues say, it is also no surprise that this class of men is more likely to sin in many different ways. And that is precisely what is observed This is why the idea to fix the scandal by having priests openly define themselves as their temptations, as advocated by among others the Washington Post, will only make everything worse The Church instead needs to return to a proper understanding of the nature of man.",

At the beginning of 2013, there are no signs that the beginning of this new oil era (regardless of its specific course) is imminent, and forecasting its onset remains an exercise in futility. Only one thing is abundantly clear to me: for the past 15 years I have been quite confident that there is no imminent danger of any sharp peak of global oil extraction followed by an inexorable production slide — and early in 2013 that confidence is greatly strengthened by new facts. Is it too much to hope that even some catastrophists and peak-oil cultists will find it impossible to ignore those numbers?",

At their massive Fall Meeting now taking place in San Francisco, the AGU should start a public education campaign aimed at revealing what science really says about this topic,” Harris said r. Madhav Khandekar stated, “Our Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change report states that there is no convincing evidence supporting a relationship between warming over the past 100 years and increases in extreme events. When the earth was cooling between 1945 and 1977, there were as many extreme weather events as there are now. The link between global warming and extreme weather is more perception than reality. Earth’s climate is robust and there is no evidence that it is being destabilized by human-added carbon dioxide [CO2]. rofessor Bob Carter, ICSC Chief Science Advisor said, “Although today’s climate and extreme weather are well within the bounds of natural variability and the intensity and magnitude of extreme events is not increasing, there is, most definitely, a climate problem. Natural climate change brings with it very real human and environmental costs. Therefore, we must carefully prepare for and adapt to climate hazards as and when they happen. Spending billions of dollars on expensive and ineffectual CO2 controls in a futile attempt to stop natural climate change impoverishes societies and reduces our capacity to address these and other real world problems.",

Once bureaucracies get regulatory and taxation powers, the exaggerations decline, scares may even be forgotten.

Why, our Sun, of course! When the Sun is in a warm phase the Earth is warmer; when the Sun moves into a cooler phase the Earth is cooler or even very cold. The Ice Ages happen during solar cool phases. We are currently living in an inter-glacial period. This sequence of events has been going on for millions of years and humans have managed to adapt nicely. Today, humans live on every part of the Earth except Antarctica he Earth has been warmer in historic times and a whole lot colder too. The glaciers melting in the mountains are relics of the last Ice Age; it is perfectly okay for them to melt. Their melting is not going to cause sea level to rise up and drown New York City, London, the entire state of Florida, the Maldives, or the Greek Islands ince 1998, world-wide temperatures have remained static, no statistically significant rise. But you already know this. Sea levels have risen in the order of millimeters, not the threatened catastrophic rises predicted by the fear mongers. You already know this too. If lower Manhattan or the Fiji Islands were being regularly submerged, it really would be news! The media would be running film on this 24/7. Have you seen anything even close to this eriously, weather prediction is good for the short term; they usually get it right for about a week. If forecasters can’t accurately predict what the weather is going to do in two weeks do you really believe anyone can accurately predict what will happen on the Earth in 10, 20, 30, years or more?

However, none of the published work has convinced me that this can explain much of the observed global warming over the last several decades. Volcanic emissions are another natural global forcing, and it is well known that they produce cooling, such as after the eruption of Mount Pintatubo, where in August of 1991 it was estimated as -4 Watts per meter squared. There have not been eruptions of that magnitude since, such that the absence of such major eruptions might permit greater absorbed solar radiation in the climate system than otherwise would occur. However, this absence of eruptions resulting in any positive radiative imbalance for a period of time well after a major volcanic emission has also not been shown to occur. This leaves anthropogenic emissions as a source for global warming. […] we limit the communication to policymakers if we use climate change as a synonym for global warming. Global warming is just one aspect of a much more complicated environmental issue.",

I’ve made a revised case of it in my book, Margaret. That’s not even my main reason for being against it. My main reason for being against this trend of stakeholder capitalism, what you could also refer to as woke capitalism, is that it is a perversion of how a constitutional republic, a democratic society is supposed to work. What the model of stakeholder capitalism calls for us to say that, no, no, no, we the people, can’t be trusted to sort out our differences on climate change or on social justice, but that we have to actually trust an enlightened group of elites to determine for the rest of society what the right answers are to those questions.

    "claim": "Fact No. 1. The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18ºC per decade. There is no evidence that this rate is increasing. If this continues to the end of the 21st century, the temperature increase will be about 1.8ºC. Some fraction of this warming is a result of natural fluctuations in the earth’s climate as well as from other non-greenhouse-related changes (changes in land use, urbanization, industrialization, data quality, etc.); there is evidence that controls on black carbon (soot) pollution could result in less warming. A warming of this magnitude is near the low end of the range of projections issued in 2001 by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Associated with a low-end warming are low-end projections of sea-level rise and other types of environmental changes Fact No. 2. During the past several decades, the earth’s vegetation has responded in an overwhelmingly positive fashion to changes in the earth’s climate. On average the growing season has lengthened (primarily by beginning earlier in the spring) and the total plant biomass has increased by about 10 percent. This remarkable growth enhancement has been due both to the fertilization effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as the beneficial effects of the patterns of climate change across the globe Fact No. 3. During the past several decades, anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide have continued to rise, but the rate of build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has leveled off. That means that the earth’s biosphere has responded by increasing the rate of carbon dioxide uptake. This is evidenced by Fact No. 2—enhanced global plant growth Fact No. 4. During the past several decades (and more), human technological advances have kept pace with, and in most cases exceeded the rate of climate change—no matter what the cause. For example, in major U.S. cities, where the thermal effects of urbanization are many times larger than the effects of any climate change, the population has become less sensitive to periods of extremely high temperature (heat waves). This is documented through declining heat wave mortality. In fact, today, many U.S. urban areas experience no increases in mortality during heat waves—a situation that was vastly different only 20 to 30 years ago.",

    "claim": "Hubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change Here’s what many people believe One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long we like Each of these presumptions—together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate—is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless Yes, it’s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, ‘I do not think “The Science” says what you think it says. For example, government reports state clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900 Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years Greenland’s ice sheet isn’t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago Why aren’t these reassuring facts better known Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media And from a media perspective, fear sells ‘Things aren’t that bad’ doesn’t sell Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data—the hard science—from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that… ‘things aren’t that bad. Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are “just physics” either doesn’t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know: I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models Let’s just take one simple, but significant assumption modelers must make: the impact of clouds on the climate Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can’t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That’s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world’s economy By the way, creating more accurate models isn’t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to ‘climate change.’ Yes, we’ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow ‘climate change’ is making everything ‘worse. Even if that were true, isn’t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that ‘worse’ is not exactly a scientific term And how would we make it better For the alarmists, that’s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels Not only is this impractical—we get over 80% of the world’s energy from fossil fuels—it’s not scientifically possible. That’s because CO2 doesn’t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years In other words, it takes centuries for the excess carbon dioxide to vanish from the atmosphere. So, any partial reductions in CO2 emissions would only slow the increase in human influences—not prevent it, let alone reverse it CO2 is not a knob that we can just turn down to fix everything. We don’t have that ability. To think that we do is… hubris Hubris leads to bad decisions A little humility and a little knowledge would lead to better ones I’m Steve Koonin, former Undersecretary for Science in the Obama Administration, and author of Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters, for Prager University.",

Now the same group says the earth might only warm 1 degree C. One degree? But the earth was that warm a thousand years ago during the last climactic optimum! So why the alarm? The chief hothouse gas is water vapor-not carbon dioxide or methane. It accounts for over 90% of global heat retention. Currently, human activity puts about 6 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere per year. Non-human activity, mostly volcanoes, accounts for about 200 billion tons. Human activity, then, constitutes 2-3% of carbon dioxide, which itself is less than 10% of the total.",

You saw perhaps a new study that just came out predicting global cooling over the next 10 years based on ocean currents.” [… And then there’s debate. These 31,000 scientists say it’s not happening. You have other scientists say it is happening. and McCain has said a long time ago that the science is settled. Well, I think there is an underlying political problem that is very interesting here. And that is that he, in the way he used his rhetoric, he basically put out of the picture any very serious person who’s concerned about the environment but is skeptical about global warming. So that becomes an impossible thing ow that’s very interesting also because Alexis de Tocqueville, the writer of Democracy in America, wrote two things. He said what sometimes happens in democratic societies is that, it’s not in a totalitarian way where you’re punished for it, but the limits of discussion become very narrow. And we’re seeing this happen with global warming where you can’t even have a serious discussion about what to do because ‘the science is settled’ according to  McCain. When, in fact, the science is not settled econd, Tocqueville predicted that democratic societies would move towards pantheism. When we see this global warming, what we’re seeing really is this view that somehow humans are a scourge on the planet. It’s an economic fallacy because it only sees humans as consumes and not also as producers and innovators, including being innovators of alternative technology sources which we see the market doing without government intervention […] […] Environmentalist policies that may or may not work, that are based on not certain data, could actually harm [the poor] and prevent economic development.",

That is a settled matter: The climate has always changed and always will. […] Nor is the crucial question whether humans are influencing the climate. That is no hoax: There is little doubt in the scientific community that continually growing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, due largely to carbon-dioxide emissions from the conventional use of fossil fuels, are influencing the climate. There is also little doubt that the carbon dioxide will persist in the atmosphere for several centuries. The impact today of human activity appears to be comparable to the intrinsic, natural variability of the climate system itself Rather, the crucial, unsettled scientific question for policy is, ‘How will the climate change over the next century under both natural and human influences?’ … Even though human influences could have serious consequences for the climate, they are physically small in relation to the climate system as a whole. … We often hear that there is a ‘scientific consensus’ about climate change. But as far as the computer models go, there isn’t a useful consensus at the level of detail relevant to assessing human influences. … Policy makers and the public may wish for the comfort of certainty in their climate science.

    "claim": "Of the many points to be made, here are a few Koonin’s analysis totally fails to consider the significant risk of very serious impacts on marine life of ocean acidification from the rising  concentration. Impacts are already affecting those growing oysters and other shelled organisms in the Pacific Northwest, and coral atolls around the world are at risk over coming decades—and that is pure chemistry totally independent of climate models Koonin’s point that the climate has changed so much in the past is actually one of the key reasons to be worried about human-induced climate change. Were the past climate stable even as the various natural forcings were changing, then there would be less reason for concern that human-induced forcings could change the climate. But reality is that past natural forcings caused significant changes in the climate—and now human activities are leading to forcings that are comparable to or even larger than natural ones in the past. In addition, the forcings being created will change climate more rapidly than have natural factors, making this unprecedented except for the catastrophic changes that have followed the impacts of large asteroids. Thus, contrary to Koonin’s assertion that past climate change suggests a policy of caution, a more appropriate conclusion would be that insights gained from past climate change should be leading to much more aggressive policy action than is now underway Yes, there is lots more to be learned, but the basic physics of the climate change issue have been clear since the 1960s when the President’s Science Advisory Council sent their report to President Johnson and Congress in 1965. Except for refrigerants of various types, human activities are adding increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (and other substances) to the atmosphere that are amplifying the natural warming effect of these substances in the atmosphere—it is not that we are not familiar with the substances we are adding to the atmosphere and have dealt with for decades. That these gases will cause warming has been recognized since the mid-19th century and adding more will surely cause more warming. Certainly, there are more questions to be investigated and resolved, and they do affect how best to adapt and other policies—but they do not alter at all the fundamental reality that human activities have become the primary driver of changes in climate, overwhelming the cycling changes in solar radiation and being much longer lasting than the occasional volcanic eruptions On sea level rise, Koonin’s comments are again mistaken and misleading. The present rate of sea level rise is well above the rate for the first half of the 20th century. The relatively stable climate that has allowed civilization to expand over the last several thousand years has kept sea level quite constant—you can still visit the coast of Sicily and find the remains of salt flats constructed in ancient times. That climate change can cause sea level to change is a key lesson from past changes in the climate that Koonin fails to mention. Since the peak of the last glacial cycle, sea level rose about 20 meters for each one degree Celsius increase in global average temperature (equivalent to a sea level rise of about 30 feet per degree Fahrenheit!!) While it took centuries or more for the full effect to be felt in the past when natural forcings were changing slowly, the adjustment will likely be much more rapid with the faster increase in forcing due to human activities. While the rate of rise will likely decrease slowly with warming because there is less ice on land to be melted, there are still about 75 meters (near 250 feet) of potential sea level rise in the ice tied up in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which have been experiencing accelerated loss of mass.",

There is little chance that wind and solar energy can displace fossil fuels, which at present account for about 80 percent of the world’s energy sources. … Given the long-term dominance of fossil fuels, the far better strategy for controlling carbon dioxide, or real pollutants like sulfur dioxide, comes from shifting from coal and oil to natural gas, and from innovating new techniques in their production, shipment, and use. Fortunately, the capital costs of getting natural gas to market have been cut in half over the last five years without costly government subsidies.

These two facts, I believe, are scientifically and technically documented and we have an obligation to address them as a society. With that said – what is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA’s CPP is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions. It’s not an environmental regulation, it is energy regulation.

During the past few months, TASSC has actively supported congressional efforts to enact regulatory reform legislation. This has included collaborating with Project Relief, drafting collateral communications materials for use by key members of Congress and helping to coordinate major events to build support for the reform movement. In addition, TASSC is currently: . conducting a state and local official outreach program to mobilize support for regulatory reform with policymakers and opinion leaders in key regions ; . collecting sound science “horror” and “success” stories from the membership for incorporation into communications materials ; and . coordinating production and placement of a series of opinion- editorials on behalf of selected TASSC scientists, state legislators and local officials ASSC is planning a two-pronged effort to generate earned media coverage of its mission, members and activities. In the near-term, TASSC will commission and disseminate a comprehensive review of the media coverage surrounding the regulatory reform effort. (Our initial assessment has revealed that during the first 100 days of the 104th Congress anti-reform editorial commentary has significantly outnumbered pro-reform pieces.) n the mid-term, TASSC will commission a broader study that will likely focus on popular media portrayal of environmental issues and its impact on public opinion . In addition, TASSC is revising its Model Sound Science and Public Policy Act (see attached draft). Once finalized, we plan to disseminate and actively build support for the new version of the model bill with member and non-member legislators prior to the 1996 legislative sessions.",

My main reason for being against this trend of stakeholder capitalism, what you could also refer to as woke capitalism, is that it is a perversion of how a constitutional republic, a democratic society is supposed to work. What the model of stakeholder capitalism calls for us to say that, no, no, no, we the people, can’t be trusted to sort out our differences on climate change or on social justice, but that we have to actually trust an enlightened group of elites to determine for the rest of society what the right answers are to those questions.

    "claim": "Climate variability has been a constant long before human beings inhabited this earth. Of course, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that can trap energy. But so is water vapor, and its levels are far harder to track because its amount and distribution are not constant across the earth’s surface. Most crucially, observed cyclical patterns of temperature change do not correlate with slow but steady increases in carbon dioxide. Recent work by climate scientists Richard Lindzen and others shows that during the so-called Holocene period (roughly covering the last 11,000 years), there was a negative correlation between temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations—strongly suggesting that carbon dioxide levels cannot be the main driver of temperature changes. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that recent climate models that have predicted sharp temperature increases have consistently run “hot,",
